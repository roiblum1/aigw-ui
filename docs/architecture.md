# Architecture

## Components

| Component | Runs on | Role |
|---|---|---|
| API server (Go) | hub | Serves the UI and the REST API, runs the sync and discovery loops |
| UI (React) | hub, inside the server image | Static files served by the API server |
| Postgres | hub | Source of truth: clusters, models, tenants, keys, quotas |
| Envoy AI Gateway | each LLM cluster | Serves the traffic. Not installed by this tool |
| Redis | hub | Shared token counters for the gateways' rate limit service. Not installed by this tool and not used by the server itself |

The server is stateless. All state is in Postgres, so the pod can be restarted
or replaced at any time.

## Two loops

**Discovery (clusters to hub).** Every `DISCOVERY_INTERVAL` (default 60s), and
when a cluster is added, the server asks each cluster which models it serves.
There are two modes, chosen per cluster by whether a Gateway URL is set.

*With a Gateway URL (recommended).* Two sources are combined:

1. `GET <gateway url>/v1/models` gives the list of model names. This is the
   gateway's own answer, so it covers routes in every namespace and every
   backend type.
2. A scan of the `AIGatewayRoute` objects in all namespaces that are attached
   to the cluster's gateway gives, for each name, the `AIServiceBackend`s it
   is served from. A quota needs these: a `QuotaPolicy` can only target an
   `AIServiceBackend`.

A model that the gateway lists but that has no `AIServiceBackend` (for example
one served from an `InferencePool`) is shown with "no quota possible", and the
API refuses a quota on it.

If either source fails, the poll fails and nothing is changed. Saving the
names without their backends would remove quota policies already in place.

*Without a Gateway URL.* Only the route scan runs, and only in the cluster's
gateway namespace.

In both modes:

- A rule exposes a model when it matches the `x-ai-eg-model` header exactly. Regex and prefix matches have no single model name and are ignored.
- The same model name on several clusters is one model with one endpoint per cluster.
- A model that disappears from a cluster loses that endpoint. The model and its quotas are kept.
- Routes created by this tool are ignored.

**Two names for one model.** If a gateway exposes the same model under two
names, such as `glm-5.3` and `publishers/llm-glm53/models/glm-5.3`, they are
two models here, each with its own quota. A tenant with a quota on both has
two separate budgets for what is really one model. Setting
`excludeFromModelsEndpoint` on the alias rule hides it from `/v1/models` and
therefore from this tool.

**Sync (hub to clusters).** After every change, and on the Sync buttons, the
server renders the desired objects for each cluster from Postgres and applies
them with server-side apply (field manager `aigw-ui`). It then deletes objects
it created earlier that are no longer wanted.

## What is applied to a cluster

| In the UI | Objects on the cluster |
|---|---|
| Model found by discovery | none; the existing route and backends are left alone |
| Model added by hand | `Backend`, `AIServiceBackend`, `AIGatewayRoute` |
| Tenant quota | one `QuotaPolicy` per model in each namespace that holds one of the model's `AIServiceBackend`s |
| Tenant API keys, with "Enforce API keys" on | one `Secret` (`aigw-ui-api-keys`) and one `SecurityPolicy` on the gateway |

All objects carry the label `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: aigw-ui`. They are
created in the cluster's gateway namespace, except a `QuotaPolicy`, which has
to be in the same namespace as the backends it targets.

**Ownership rule.** The server only ever deletes an object that carries that
label. The label is checked on the hub as well as in the API query, so a
cluster's own routes cannot be removed by a sync.

## How a tenant quota is enforced

1. A key has the client ID `<tenant>.<random>`, for example `team-search.5018d00f`.
2. The gateway's API key auth validates the key and forwards the client ID in the `x-aigw-client-id` header.
3. The model's `QuotaPolicy` has one bucket rule per tenant that matches `^<tenant>\.[a-f0-9]+$`, so all keys of a tenant share one bucket.
4. The gateway's quota rate limit service counts tokens in Redis.

`QuotaPolicy` runs in `Shared` mode: a request passes if any matching bucket
has quota left, and it is also charged to the model's default bucket. The
default bucket is therefore a shared pool for tenants that have no quota of
their own. It defaults to 1 token per day, which in practice makes a quota
mandatory once a model has any quota.

## One budget across sites

Counters add up across sites when all of these hold:

- every cluster's quota rate limit service uses the same Redis (on the hub);
- the gateway namespace is the same on every cluster;
- the `AIServiceBackend` for a model has the same name on every cluster.

For models added by hand the tool guarantees the names. For discovered models
the names are yours.

## Not verified on a real gateway

The rendered objects follow the published API, but these points have not been
run against a live Envoy AI Gateway:

- the `forwardClientIDHeader` field of the API key `SecurityPolicy`;
- that a `RegularExpression` client selector puts all matching keys in one bucket;
- that counters are shared when two clusters use the same Redis;
- that a quota takes effect on a backend whose route sets no `modelNameOverride`. The gateway documents that a quota "only applies when its `modelName` matches the `modelNameOverride`" and says nothing about routes without one. The UI marks these backends "quota unverified";
- that `/v1/models` still answers once "Enforce API keys" is on. If it needs a key, set the cluster's API key for `/v1/models`.

Check them on one test cluster with the Manifests preview before a first sync
to production.

## Requirements on each LLM cluster

- Envoy Gateway with the `Backend` API enabled.
- Envoy AI Gateway 1.0 or later (`QuotaPolicy`).
- For quotas: the dedicated quota rate limit service, pointed at the hub Redis. The AI gateway Helm chart does not deploy it.

The Test button on the Clusters page reports which of the CRDs are installed.
